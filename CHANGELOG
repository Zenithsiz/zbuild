# 0.1.3

## Major

- Exit code is now non-0 when a build error occurs

- (BREAKING) Execution of rules is now stopped at the first build error.

  However, when a rule starts execution, all of it's commands will be executed, unless one errors. This is to ensure you'll never be left with output files that aren't finalized.

- Majorly improved error handling. A list of all errors is printed after all builds are stopped, to ensure errors aren't lost in the output.

## Minor

- Parent directories of built files are no longer watched recursively.

  This improves performance when watching files that have non-watched sibling directories that change often. Sibling files are still unfortunately still watched.

# 0.1.2

## Major

- Added commands within commands. Arguments to commands may now be commands themselves. The stdout of the command will be captured and passed as the argument.

- (BREAKING) Working directory is now for each command, rather than for the executable section

## Minor

- (BREAKING) Option `--file-log` is now `--log-file`

- Parent directories of built files now watched to ensure that deleted files are still properly watched.

  This may cause some slowdowns if you're watching a file in a directory with a lot of movement, but it otherwise fixes some files randomly not being watched.
