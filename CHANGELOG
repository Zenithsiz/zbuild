# 0.1.2

## Major

- Added commands within commands. Arguments to commands may now be commands themselves. The stdout of the command will be captured and passed as the argument.

- (BREAKING) Working directory is now for each command, rather than for the executable section

## Minor

- (BREAKING) Option `--file-log` is now `--log-file`

- Parent directories of built files now watched to ensure that deleted files are still properly watched.

  This may cause some slowdowns if you're watching a file in a directory with a lot of movement, but it otherwise fixes some files randomly not being watched.
